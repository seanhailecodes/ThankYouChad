                    <p> I just wanted to again thank you, in our own special way, for taking the time to speak with me today. </p>
                        <p>
                            After having the opportunity to speak with you I am even more confident in my ability to make immediate and significant impact to your team. I am a front end developer and technical engineer with strong familiarity with your entire tech stack - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Github, CICD, and gosh oh golly do I get gitty when I hear, see, or get to code React - it's my go-to. If this where a single page app, I still would have built it for you in React. Additionally, I've built full stack web applications utilizing back end technologies and frameworks, Node.js, Express, Ruby, PHP, SQL; Cassandra db I have begun studying now. Within my tier of support I believe I am the only one, or one of very few, who was able to boot an instance of PingDirectory on my virtual machine by way of Linux distribution (Ubuntu), further testament to my technical abilities. I will thrive working within your "Pingy" Agile work environment and am relishing just the opportunity to do so. As your next front end developer I will insure your team(s) continue to deliver the highest quality interfaces within our industry. I recieved 4 promotions over the past 10 years utilizing an exemplary array of elite professional attributes which I continue to hone, they've gotten me here to you today, and I will apply them to your team immediately and perpetually so I can overcome any limitations due to lack of experience.
