                In addition to a strong tech stack, I bring technical expertise within our field of cybersecurity. As a Ping employee, you can easily speak directly to my superiors Eddy Cruz. I bring to you easily verifiable and transparent references with a crystal clear view of my work history. This transfer presents minimal risk for either of us, while the opportunity correlates to the synergistic trajectory of our company, your team, and my professional growth - all strong indicators of success. Also, for our organization as a whole, all of the Identians within our rapidly growing organization will see that there are opportunities for advancement. Practically, I would argue that my more recent entry in to the field is of benefit to you, as your front end developer I would be wildly excited to land at a mid sixties salary point, as that is a significant increase for me and I love the job. I would not imagine any applicants can match my desire, or entry point. Last, certainly not least, I have an extremely high level of motivation - no one out works me.
