          <p> 
          I have extensive familiarity with our product driven professional work environment. In addition to a strong tech stack, I bring technical expertise within our field of cybersecurity. As a Ping employee, I bring to you easily verifiable and transparent references with a clear vision of my work history. There is very low risk for either of us. This opportunity correlates to the synergistic trajectory of our company, your team, and my professional growth - all around wins for everyone including all of the Identians within our rapidly growing organization who see that there are opportunities for advancement. I would argue that my recent entry in to the field could be a benefit to you, as your front end developer I would be wildly excited to land at a mid to high 60k salary while others may or may not.
